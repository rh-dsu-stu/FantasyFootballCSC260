# FantasyFootballCSC260

This program accepts NFL player names from the console and then looks them up via the sportsdata.io NFL API. The corresponding NuGet was used.
Stats can then be looked up for a given team on a week by week basis. Teams can be saved to a MongoDB database and revisted later. 

Future updates include player news from rotoworld and fantasy projections for each week.
